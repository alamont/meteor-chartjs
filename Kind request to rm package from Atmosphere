Hi @alamont,

I'm a volunteer Meteor developer helping with the package migration to Atmosphere.

A Twitter user was confused about the many Chart.js wrappers on Atmosphere -

I've just created a community-maintained package according to the guidelines at
https://github.com/raix/Meteor-community-discussions/issues/14
It includes autoamtted tests, a visual test, a Gulpfile, and Travis.yml.

We'd appreciate if you can help us keep Atmosphere clean by hiding
[this package](https://atmospherejs.com/alamont/chartjs) from Atmoshpere searches:

    meteor admin set-unmigrated alamont:chartjs

The package will still be installable by apps and other packages that depend on it;
it will just be hidden from Atmosphere searches.
    
Thanks and best regards,
Dan
